                <p>In eternal babylon where reason serves the sensual</br>
                    Lady luck will turn to gold all blades drawn out</br>
                    Muses clad in leopard skin spin around an offering</br>
                    Left is behind a feast fit for the palate of sun king</br>
                    The wining and dining stops when a sorceress steps up</br>
                    And chants a spell to a tune of a great symphony</p>
                    
                    <p>Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    She sang the strangest song </br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    All the children danced along</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    She sang the strangest song</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    The birdies joined in to the choir</p>
                     
                    <p>Get enamored by her face she'll give you the medusa's gaze</br>
                    In the hanging garden left there standing as a gnome</br>
                    The sublimations and the love poured from cornucopia</br>
                    Adoration born of fear will animate us all</p>
                    
                    <p>Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    She sang the strangest song</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    All the children danced along</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    She sang the strangest song</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    The birdies joined in to the choir</p>
                    
                    <p>All that perishes bends to her whim</br>
                    The spell echoes so far ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    Oh how blessed we are</p>
                    
                    <p>Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    She sang the strangest song</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>
                    All the children danced along</br>
                    Ja simbilam malibmis aj</br>

                <p>*Instrumental*</p>
                <h2 id="Bastard">Bastard's Fugue</h2>
                <p>As the airwaves cry</br>
                    And the pictures flaunt</br>
                    Everyone’s allured</br>
                    The charade is on</p>
                    
                    <p>It seems well-conceived</br>
                    But I can tell</br>
                    That something brews beneath</br>
                    Someone did a deed</br>
                    So debauched, so vile</br>
                    Don’t want to know</br>
                    ‘bout what went on or why</br>
                    Smiling beauty queen</br>
                    Immortalized, forever asleep</br>
                    Coked-up troubadours</br>
                    Singing hollow praise</br>
                    Of just themselves</br>
                    Knowing they’ll be forgotten one day</br>
                    But we’re all amused</br>
                    And at the same time so subtly engineered</p>
                    
                    <p>It seems ill-conceived</br>
                    And it gets worse</br>
                    Far as I can see</br>
                    Dig this travesty</br>
                    Get desensitized</br>
                    And you will cope</br>
                    With the bare-faced lie</br>
                    Tell me, did your idol get</br>
                    Shat on by some dysgenic pleb</br>
                    Did your noble cause</br>
                    Get usurped and whored</br>
                    The clown-show is what we get</br>
                    ‘cause you reap what you sow</p>
                    
                    <p>Slick and sassy message</br>
                    And that urban sensibility</br>
                    And people just ignore the idolatry</br>
                    You’d might as well watch porno</br>
                    Well the difference is so vague by now</br>
                    ‘cause all things wholesome have been bastardized</br>
                    You’d might as well watch porno</br>
                    ‘cause it’s all been turned to usury</br>

                <p>To trust you, I need you stripped of all</br>
                    Fame and fortune, so spoke the slave</br>
                    Master scoffs and affirms his dominance</br>
                    Master laughs and gives him the cane</p>
                    
                    <p>To see you as a full-fledged human being</br>
                    Imitate me, so master spoke</br>
                    Slave whimpers and suckles on his wounds</br>

                <p>In their rendering, the philosopher kings, stood firm</br>
                    As engineers and seers, of the finest pedigree</br>
                    Poured their minds, and in their brilliance and hubris</br>
                    They set on to probe their way to god</p>
                    
                    <p>To fight against mortality, to tear the seam of time and space</br>
                    Control the course of history, unto cosmos they’d carve their face</br>
                    To synthesize divinity, to simulate a paradise with mere mundane means</p>
                    
                    <p>An arcane theorem, brought to its ultimate</br>
                    Elements and energy, that defy reality</br>
                    Oh the lives the ordeal is sure to claim</br>
                    Induced unity of matter and spirit</br>
                    Attention to detail down to (the) level of planck length</br>
                    An anticipation of something infinite</br>
                    Meters very plain, for measures very great</br>
                    Experimental risks, few atomized by slip</br>
                    A dozen more will lose their sanity</br>
                    An artificial rift of body and spirit</br>
                    Measurements unknown, with metrics never shown</br>
                    But they will bring about what they’ve set upon</br>
                    The singularity, they’ve passed by already</br>
                    And they celebrate, the forging of their fate</br>
                    But do they really know what they’ve brought upon?</p>

                    They probed their way to god</br>
                    The singularity, far passed and now they see</br>
                    Produced by their machine, a providence supreme</br>

                <p>*Instrumental*</p></br>
                <h2>Facade</h2>
                <p>Crowd of people wandering through the city streets</br>
                    In their mere presence it keeps conveying to me</br>
                    All thoughts and Ideals, one would like to neglect</br>
                    Stripped down and clarified from their inner depth</p>
                    
                    <p>I had yearned a skill to scan the minds of men</br>
                    My predictments were severely wrong back then</br>
                    The shallow human will which never aims to evolve</br>
                    Alleged complexity which only turned out to be</br>
                    A facade</p>
                    
                    <p>Take a deeper view and see what is within</br>
                    The particles that make a man's identity</br>
                    Like pages of a memo they reflect what we want</br>
                    But not what we really are</br>
                    Unto the words that were not left unsaid without a cause</p>
                    
                    <p>To hide that insecurity a mask is worn</br>
                    To camouflage that vanity with all that talk</br>
                    Well I’m the one seeing through it, so I’m to be the judge</br>
                    A smile I know not to be real</br>
                    Lies and hypocrisy, deception which I’m forced to bear</p>
                    
                    <p>If it would have a face the ugliness would bloom</br>
                    I found it’s inner core, the surface hid the truth</br>
                    Yes knowledge can be gained, it never will be lost</br>
                    The burden remains, ignorance was it’s cost</p>
                    
                    <p>They claim that some are saints among the wretched in here</br>
                    But in the end they’re same, in pursuits and fears</br>
                    One among them, one witness to it all</br>
                    Who sees, man’s ambitions fall</br>
                    But why, oh god, oh why? Turned out to be me</p>
                    
                    <p>Everywhere around me wherever they may be</br>
                    This exploitive ailment, without my consent</br>
                    Quickens, and these surges hollow out whats left</p>
                    
                    <p>If it would have a face the ugliness would bloom</br>
                    I found it’s inner core, the surface hid the truth</br>
                    Yes knowledge can be gained, it never will be lost</br>
                    The burden remains, ignorance was it’s cost</br>
                    And only thing that’s left, this self-hate and regret</br>
                    The nobility they claimed was just a facade</p>
                    
                    <p>My debilitated mind, found the emptiness inside</br>
                    And then I sought refuge, in my solitude</br>
                    </p></br>
